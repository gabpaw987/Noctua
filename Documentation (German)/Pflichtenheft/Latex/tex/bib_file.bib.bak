  abstract = {Since a number of years agent technology is considered one of the
	most innovative technologies for the development of distributed software
	systems. While not yet a mainstream approach in software engineering
	at large, a lot of work on agent technology has been done, many research
	results and applications have been presented, and some software products
	exists which have moved from the research community to the industrial
	community. One of these is JADE, a software framework that facilitates
	development of interoperable intelligent multi-agent systems and
	that is distributed under an Open Source License. JADE is a very
	mature product, used by a heterogeneous community of users both in
	research activities and in industrial applications. This paper presents
	JADE and its technological components together with a discussion
	of the possible reasons for its success and lessons learned from
	the somewhat detached perspective possible nine years after its inception.},

	skills and is supervised by an agent with related objectives and
	knowledge. An agent has an ontology-based world model, which is responsible
	to maintain the knowledge about the robot's activities in relation
	to its environment as well as to its underlying software parts. The
	ontology is used to represent a specification of an agent's domain
	knowledge. The system functionality is tested with three mobile robots
	having a task to disassembly a particular Lego construct.},

	functions are estimates of the number of edges that remain to be
	traversed in reaching a goal node. A number of theoretical results
	for this model, and the intuition for these results, are presented.
	They relate the efficiency of search to the accuracy of the heuristic
	function. The results also explore efficiency as a consequence of
	the reliance or weight placed on the heuristics used.},
