\chapter*{Abstract}

High frequency trading of stocks and other securities often involve multiple transactions per day and depend on both real-time data
and computer-systems to process them.
Methods for analysing price movements and identifying opportune moments to buy or sell exist in abundance are can usually be
implemented in software.\\

This final year project is concerned with the development and programming of an algorithmic trading strategy for securities
utilising Technical Analysis and charting techniques. 
Therefore, diverse indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Average Directional Index (ADX) or the Bollinger Bands and methods such as the development of trading systems
with Moving Averages (MAs) or regression analysis are described, tested and evaluated. Resulting are two dif\-ferent approaches, both have been
gradually improved, if adequately parameters have been provided and are even able to trade profitable without human intervention.\\

In order to facilitate the evaluation of such algorithms in general and of this algorithm specifically, a software has been developed to
measure the resulting performance from calculations on historical data, which in the following is denoted as Backtesting Software (BTS).
With a graphical user interface, intuitive design and informative charts, the software meets the high requirements and demands of user-friendliness and usability.
